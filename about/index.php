        <p><b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b></p>
        <p><b>WHAT IS TORREY PINES ABOUT?</p></b>
        <p>Torrey Pines is a stop-motion animated feature film by director Clyde Petersen. Based on a true story, the film is a queer punk coming-of-age tale, taking place in Southern California in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Raised by a schizophrenic single mother, Petersen's life story unfolds in a series of baffling and hallucinated events. With a mother fueled by hallucinations of political conspiracy and family dysfunction, Petersen is kidnapped at the age of 12 and taken on a cross-country adventure that will forever alter the family as they know it.</p>
      <br>
      <p><b>I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IS IT A MOVIE OR A THEATRICAL PIECE?</b></p>
      Torrey Pines is both a complete feature film, and a touring theatrical show. The film has a soundtrack produced by Chris Walla, while the live theatrical version has a score performed by the band Your Heart Breaks and special guests, including Kimya Dawson, Lori Goldston, The Beaconettes (an amazing chior from Seattle, Washington), Corey J. Brewer, Chris Looney and Art Petersen.
